## Kayo Sports Maximum Resolution

A Chrome Extension that forces the maximum resolution for Kayo Sports to be applied

Highly inspired by <a href="https://github.com/logore/amazon-prime-video-1080p/">Amazon Prime Video 1080p</a>
<br>

## How does it work?
~~The script loaded on Kayo Sports determines the quality of the video by the size of the browser window, so it just rewrites it on page load.~~

Rewrites the Media Presentation Description (MPD) used for video streaming and replaces it with the highest quality video.

<br>

## Installation
Manually... Check the video on the inspired Repository
